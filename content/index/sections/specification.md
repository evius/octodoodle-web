Octopi have 10 traits and an asset for each trait will be randomly selected. Some traits require at least one selection while others may not be selected at all. Assets are classified into three tiers which define the probability of the asset appearing in a generated Cryptopi.

<br>

- Tier 0 - 69% probability.
- Tier 1 - 20% probability.
- Tier 2 - 1% probability.

<br>

Traits will be stored on the chain.
