Investment art is a strange and fascinating world where you get to make money while enjoying the finer things in life. Investment art has been around for a long time and seems to have found a place on the cutting edge of technological advancement. Blockchain technology.

The NFT collectable space is crowded and confusing (or easily misunderstood). There are no clear rules on what you can and can’t do (and there are so many things to do). The parallels to the investment art world are clear, however, albeit in a slightly different dress.

There’s not a whole lot you can do with a piece of digital art, unfortunately. Your avatar or profile picture is one of the few places where you can express your taste and show off.

With this in mind, we aim to distil a part of the NFT collectable world by focusing on these things.
- Create and share something of beauty.
- Provide you with a great piece of investment art.
- Be pragmatic about digital art by focusing on artistic avatars (for now at least)
- Connect the wider art community with the NFT collectable art community and investment art.

If all this sounds a little too serious, the art itself can be very playful, and that’s what we hope to bring you.

Cryptopi Crew will be part of multiple unique and innovative collections. We're striving to create a brand that you will love and trust. Each new collection will drive the floor price of all our collectables.
