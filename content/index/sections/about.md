Who doesn’t love an octopus? They have an incredible neural network in their eight arms, are really smart, can camouflage to multiple environments and squeeze through really tight spaces. Now they’re taking over everything…

Cryptopi is a collection of 9001 unique artworks randomly generated from over 200 hand drawn traits. Some are cute, some aren't.

There's no fantastic back story. We just want to bring you something that you will love and enjoy and one of many more great collections.

We'll be donating 20 ETH to [Sea Shepherd UK](https://www.seashepherd.org.uk), a marine wildlife conservation organisation to help protect amazing creatures like Octopi.
