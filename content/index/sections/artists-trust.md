The Artists Trust is our primary mission and focus for this collection of Octodoodles. We realise how difficult it is to get a step-up in the world as an artist and that, unfortunately, the arts have become bit of a second rate citizen. This has been the case for many years but has become even more compounded during recent times.

The Artists Trust will serve to help, 
<br>

- Artists who are mothers and raising children while trying to maintain a successful art career.
- Upcoming artists who are struggling to get a foot in the door.
- Artists in Third-World countries who might not have access to various media.
- Artists who have suffered as a result of lock downs.
- Artists who have suffered as a result of brick and mortar galleries closing down.

<br>
In addition we also want to give back and help drive the art community by, 
<br>
<br>

- Finding diamonds in the rough.
- Hosting annual art competitions with a great prize.
- Incubating, funding and mentoring up and coming artists.
- Helping peoples passions and dreams to come alive.

<br>
To make this possible, we'll be taking 5% of all secondary sales of which 2.5% will be put into an Artist's Trust wallet.

As a Octodoodle holder, you have special access to an area on our Discord server where you can contribute to how the trust is used with the above aims.
