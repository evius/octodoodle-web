Unfortunately, the arts have become a second rate citizen in our modern culture with arts education receiving little or no funding. It's also difficult for emerging artists to gain a foothold in the industry, especially in times of economic hardship.

We'll be taking 5% of all secondary sales in an attempt to set a trend for individual artists who should be benefiting more from secondary sales and are often undervalued.

Of this 5%, we'll put half into an artist's trust wallet which our members will help decide what to do with.
